# tcl-crystal

Tcl for Crystal.  Bindings to the Tcl C-library

## Installation

This is currently just a sample library and example that shows how a Tcl interpreter can be embedded in a Crystal executable.

## Usage

`libtcl.cr` contains the bindings to Tcl.  Only a small subset of functions are currently supported.

Check out the [example code](src/tcl_crystal_example.cr) to see how `LibTcl` can be used.

## Development

It is unclear how featured this needs to be in order to be usable.
`LibTcl` may want to be wrapped into a more crystal-like interface in order to improve the interface ergnomics and make it more crystal-like.

Contributions are welcome.
